    <h1>P2 - Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Making the Site</h2>
    <p>I choose to revamp the Giphy finder due to personal circumstances. I was originally gonna use the pokemon TCG api, but due <br>
    to a lack of time, I could not use it. I went with a royal purple scheme to make it feel like you are watching a teather of GIFs
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements and Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 controls</li>
        <li>Using own Giphy API key</li>
        <li>Searching and loading gif</li>
        <li>popular</li>
        <li>copy link</li>
        <li>rating</li>
        <li>Previous and Next Button</li>
        <li>Commented</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Self Assessments</h2>
    <p>Overall, I wish I had more time to implement more features. I was able to get most of the functionality working<br>
        I would give myself a B.
